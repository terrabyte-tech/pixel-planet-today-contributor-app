# Pixel Planet Today: Contributor Application

This application will be a web application that will allow contributors to submit environmental topics, post ideas, and graphic ideas for Pixel Planet Today posts. This will create a better sense of community and make the Pixel Planet Today post creation process more efficient.

Future updates will allow contributors to edit past submissions and in-app administration of submissions by a Terrabyte admin.
